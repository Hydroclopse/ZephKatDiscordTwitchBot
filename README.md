# ZephKatDiscordTwitchBot

This bot, when run from a desktop computer will provide a sorting system and program launching functionality
for Twitch content navigation; later on something similiar will be adapted into a discord bot.

Maybe, the core functionality will be split into two projects if the premises are incompatible.
