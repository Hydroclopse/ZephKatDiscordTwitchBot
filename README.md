# ZephKatDiscordTwitchBot

This bot, when run from a desktop computer will integrate with a linked discord server and parse an indicated (through chat commands) Twitch stream for display through a linked webpage.

Maybe, the core functionality will be split into two projects if the premises are incompatible.
